# CTensor

CTensor is a simple and lightweight tensor-like library in pure C. The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-understand implementation of fundamental tensor operations, and provide a hands-on learning experience for me (and hopefully others :)) into the internal intrisics of neural network frameworks.

CTensor implements a Sequential Model architecture, meaning that each layer will only have exactly one input tensor and one output tensor.

This library is currently a Work-In-Progress (WIP), as such the API/ABI shall be considered highly unstable!
